<div className='py-8 px-16 border border-border rounded-lg bg-black'>
<DataTableDemo />
</div>

## Introduction

This is an add-on to your existing shadcn/ui data table component. It adds client-side filtering with a clean, modern UI inspired by [Linear](https://linear.app/homepage).

This component relies on [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table), a headless UI for building powerful tables & datagrids.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Create your `<DataTable />` component. You can follow the [shadcn/ui docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/data-table) for guidance.
- Ensure you're using client-side filtering.

## Installation

From the command line, install the component into your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add alert-dialog
```

## Introduction

This is an add-on to your existing shadcn/ui data table component. It adds client-side filtering with a clean, modern UI inspired by [Linear](https://linear.app/homepage).

This component relies on [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table), a headless UI for building powerful tables & datagrids.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Create your `<DataTable />` component. You can follow the [shadcn/ui docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/data-table) for guidance.
- Ensure you're using client-side filtering.

## Installation

From the command line, install the component into your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.bazza.dev/r/data-table-filter.json
```

## Usage

## Overview

Let's take a high-level look at how we've created the data table filter component.

This will help you understand what each file contains and the general component composition.

### File structure

The data table filter component is composed of several files.

Components are placed in the `@/components` directory and broken up into several files for better organization and readability:

- `data-table-filter.tsx`: The main component file.
- `property-filter-list.tsx`: Renders the applied filters.
- `property-filter-subject.tsx`: Renders the **subject** of a filter, which shows the property name and (optionally) icon.
- `property-filter-operator.tsx`: Renders the filter **operator** controller, which handles how the filter value is applied to the property.
- `property-filter-value.tsx`: Renders the filter **value** controller, which is the actual value that is being filtered on.
- `table-filter-actions.tsx`: The actions that can be performed on the filter, such as clearing the filter.
- `table-filter-menu.tsx`: The filter menu, which is a dropdown menu that appears when clicking on the filter icon. This allows the user to initially start filtering on a property.
- `debounced-input.tsx`: A custom input component that uses the `useDebounce` hook from the `react-use` library.

Types, interfaces, and utilities are placed in the `@/lib` directory:

- `array.ts`: Utility functions for working with arrays.
- `filters.ts`: All TypeScript types, interfaces, and constants related to the data table filter component. Also includes the filter functions `filterFn()` for each column type.
- `table.ts`: Utility functions for working with the TanStack Table library.

### Component structure

A `PropertyFilterItem` component is composed of the following parts:

- `PropertyFilterSubject` shows the name and *(optionally)* icon of the property being filtered on.
- `PropertyFilterOperator` shows the operator used to filter on the property.
- `PropertyFilterValue` shows the actual filter value.

The `PropertyFilterOperator` and `PropertyFilterValue` components are represented by a `Controller` which is essentially a `Popover` with an associated trigger and content.

We can break down the `PropertyFilterValueController` as an example:

- `PropertyFilterValueDisplay` is the popover **trigger**. This displays the filter value for the associated property.
- `PropertyFilterValueMenu` is the popover **content**. This renders the menu for modifying the filter value.

The `PropertyFilterOperatorController` has a similar composition and can be inferred from the above description and image.

## Walkthough

Let's walk through a simple example of how we can use the data table filter component to add client-side filtering to our shadcn/ui data table.

### Scenario

Let's build a data table for an issue tracker. We can define the shape of an `Issue` as follows:

```ts
export type Issue = {
  id: string
  title: string
  description?: string
  status: IssueStatus
  labels?: IssueLabel[]
  assigneeId?: string
  startDate?: Date
  endDate?: Date
  estimatedHours?: number
}
```
